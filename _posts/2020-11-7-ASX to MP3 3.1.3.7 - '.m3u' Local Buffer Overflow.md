In this blog post we will be looking onto a Buffer Overflow Vulnerability which was found in ASX to MP3 converter application. We will be reproducing the exploit from scratch in order to learn more about BOFs.

If you are new to Buffer Overflows i will recommend you to read a comprehensive guide which i wrote for the newbies to get familiar with the basics of Buffer Overflows and how to exploit this vulnerability. 

- https://github.com/deFr0ggy/BOF-Basics

I will be using Windows XP machine to reproduce this vulnerability. The tools which we require are mentioned as above. 

### Tools of the trade
- Immunity Debugger
- Mona
- Python 

### Operating System
- Windows XP - SP3

### Vulnerable Software
- https://www.exploit-db.com/apps/f4da5b43ca4b035aae55dfa68daa67c9-ASXtoMP3Converter.exe

# Let's Get Into It

The first thing is to download the vulnerable software from the provided link and install it on the machine. Once installed we can run the software which looks like as follows.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/1.png)

The Buffer Overflow vulnerability can be exploited by adding the M3U file to the application. As per WikiPedia, M3U files are:

> M3U (MP3 URL or Moving Picture Experts Group Audio Layer 3 Uniform Resource Locator in full) is a computer file format for a multimedia playlist. ... Although originally designed for audio files, such as MP3, it is commonly used to point media players to audio and video sources, including online sources.

So we come to conclusion that this file contains the URLs and the URL has to start with HTTP or HTTPS. We can generate a random M3U file by using python. 

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/2.png)

On loading the generated file in the application we can see that the application has failed to load the file. This is because we don't have anything in that for the time being. 

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/3.png)

Let's modify our code and add a buffer i.e. A character 2000 times. On generating the file and loading it within the application we can see the error which is nothing but a sequence of A characters. There is something really wrong going on here.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/4.png)

We can not exploit it any further by just playing around with the application. We will need a debugger. We will use Immunity Debugger. Drag & Drop the application executable onto Immunity Debugger. Once loaded you will see that the application has been loaded into the Immunity Debugger and is in paused state. 

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/5.png)

Click on the play/start button to start the application.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/6.png)

Now we will drag & drop the exploit.m3u file on the application but the thing which is requireed to be noted here is that we still haven't got the buffer overflow. We will need to add more buffer to our file.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/7.png)

Now, we will increase the buffer size from 2000 to 19999 and will generate a new file and will utilize that to see what is the output in the Immunity Debugger.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/9.png)

Now, we will be using Mona.py in order to generate a stream of token to find the offset. Copy and paste the Mona.py file to the above directory. 

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/10.png)

Once, done we will use !mona pattern_create module to generate a stream of tokens. 

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/11.png)

This token is saved in the default Immunity Debugger installation folder. 

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/12.png)

From here we will add this token to our exploit code to look for the offset. 

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/13.png)

We see that there are some characters in the EIP register. Note down this value and by using pattern_offset we can calculate the offset value. Note down this value.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/14.png)

Now as we know the offset of EIP register we can try to modify our code to check if we are able to successfully control the EIP register or not. 

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/14a.png)

We can see that we have overwritten the EIP and ESP contains a steam of "A" characters. This proves that we are directly overwriting the EIP pointer and this type of Buffer Overflow is known as Direct Overflow / Vanilla Overflow because in such type of buffer overflows we can directly control the Instruction Pointer. From here we will move onto the exploitation phase and will end at running the caluclator on Windows XP by exploiting this vulnerability. 

We somehow need to execute our malicious instruction. When we added a lot of buffer we have noticed that ESP register starts to fill with characters. As for now, we can overwrite the EIP, we will add a stream of chracters to our exploit and will see if we can overwride the ESP register. So our exploit code becomes as above.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/15.png)

We can see that we are overwriting the ESP register. From here we need to find the instruction within the program which makes a call to the data in ESP register. In order to find that we will again use Mona.py to find the JMP instructions. These instruction are JUMP instruction which forwards the flow of execution of program from one place to another. 

We will use the above mona command to find the possibilities.

```
!mona jmp -r ESP
```
We can see that mona has found multiple JMP instructions. Mona saves all these files in jmp.txt file which is present in Immunity Debugger default installation directory. On opening the file we can see the same data which is much more readable. 

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/16.png)

We will select the above module! 

```
Log data, item 23
 Address=7608BCE1
 Message=  0x7608bce1 : jmp esp |  {PAGE_EXECUTE_READ} [MSVCP60.dll] ASLR: False, Rebase: False, SafeSEH: True, OS: True, v6.02.3104.0 (C:\WINDOWS\system32\MSVCP60.dll)
```

We need to note down the address of this JUMP instruction which is 7608BCE1. On double clicking on this instruction we can see that this is indeed a jump instruction. Press F2 to add a breakpoint. 

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/17.png)

Once the breakpoint has been added we will move onto editing our exploit code. Replace the "B" with the address "\xE1\xBC\x08\x76" and generate the new m3u file. 

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/18.png)

On loading this file in the player we can see that our execution has halted on our breakpoint which we set on the JMP ESP instruction.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/19.png)

After this click on the Step Into button from the menu bar and we can see a set of INC EBX instruction. The thing which is required to be noted here is "C" in ascii is 43 and also the ASM instruction INC EBX has the opcode 0x43. N

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/20.png)

ow both of these are same. If we try to read the buffer we will end up in a loop which will lead to a program crash. 

What we can do here is that we can add a breakpoint instruction right after the jump instruction. So as soon as we jump to our buffer the program execution will be stopped. We will add "\xcc" opcode. Which is the opcode for BreakPoint!

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/21.png)

We will regenerate the file and will load it in the application. We see that there is an Access Violation Error. Which tells that we have been landed somewhere pretty wrong, in this case we are landed in between our buffer. 

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/22.png)

So what we can do is we can add a number of padding called NOPS (No Operation) instruction. Which does nothing but formats the space. 

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/23.png)

In this case we have added 60 No-Operation instructions. Let's re-generate the file and load it in within the application. 

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/24.png)

We can see that we are now landed to the location of our choice. Now before we generate the shellcode, we will check for the any character which will act as a terminator. 0x00, 0x0a, 0x0d, 0xff are often treated as terminators. So we will need to avoid these! 

The easiest way to check for all such terminators is to supply the whole ASCII table. Which can be done as above. 

```
badchars = ("\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x0e\x0f\x10\x11\x12\x13\x14\x15\x16\x17\x18\x19\x1a\x1b\x1c\x1d\x1e\x1f"
"\x20\x21\x22\x23\x24\x25\x26\x27\x28\x29\x2a\x2b\x2c\x2d\x2e\x2f\x30\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x3a\x3b\x3c\x3d\x3e\x3f\x40"
"\x41\x42\x43\x44\x45\x46\x47\x48\x49\x4a\x4b\x4c\x4d\x4e\x4f\x50\x51\x52\x53\x54\x55\x56\x57\x58\x59\x5a\x5b\x5c\x5d\x5e\x5f"
"\x60\x61\x62\x63\x64\x65\x66\x67\x68\x69\x6a\x6b\x6c\x6d\x6e\x6f\x70\x71\x72\x73\x74\x75\x76\x77\x78\x79\x7a\x7b\x7c\x7d\x7e\x7f"
"\x80\x81\x82\x83\x84\x85\x86\x87\x88\x89\x8a\x8b\x8c\x8d\x8e\x8f\x90\x91\x92\x93\x94\x95\x96\x97\x98\x99\x9a\x9b\x9c\x9d\x9e\x9f"
"\xa0\xa1\xa2\xa3\xa4\xa5\xa6\xa7\xa8\xa9\xaa\xab\xac\xad\xae\xaf\xb0\xb1\xb2\xb3\xb4\xb5\xb6\xb7\xb8\xb9\xba\xbb\xbc\xbd\xbe\xbf"
"\xc0\xc1\xc2\xc3\xc4\xc5\xc6\xc7\xc8\xc9\xca\xcb\xcc\xcd\xce\xcf\xd0\xd1\xd2\xd3\xd4\xd5\xd6\xd7\xd8\xd9\xda\xdb\xdc\xdd\xde\xdf"
"\xe0\xe1\xe2\xe3\xe4\xe5\xe6\xe7\xe8\xe9\xea\xeb\xec\xed\xee\xef\xf0\xf1\xf2\xf3\xf4\xf5\xf6\xf7\xf8\xf9\xfa\xfb\xfc\xfd\xfe\xff")
```

We will add this to our exploit code and will create a new executable.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/25.png)

On loading the file within the application we can see the HEX values. As m3u files are read line by line, it is obvious that CR LF
bytes are line terminators. So we will remove 0x00, 0x0a, 0x0d and 0x20 from the shellcode which we are going to generate. 

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/26.png)

Now we will be using MSFVenom to generate our shellcode.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/27.png)

Once our shellcode has been generated, we will remove the bad-characters and will add our generated code in the shellcode buffer space. 

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/28.png)

Finally we will generate a new file and will load it within the application. 

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/29.png)

We can see that calculator has been prompted. Now we will make a final move. We will run the application without the debugger and will load the exploit in it. 

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deFr0ggy/deFr0ggy.github.io/master/images/ASXtoMP3/30.png)

We saw that the main application was closed and calculator application loaded up proving that we have successfully exploited the Buffer Overflow vulnerability.
