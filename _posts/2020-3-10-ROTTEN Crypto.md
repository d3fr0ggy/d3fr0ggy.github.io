In this write-up we will be solving the ROTTEN Crypto challenge which as the name suggests has to do something with ROT (Rotations) cryptographic scheme.

A text file was provided with this challenge on opening which we found the rotated text.

As we already had a clue that this text is rotated we quicky moved onto **rot13.com**, pasted the text there and started checking for the rotations. ROT-16 gave us our flag which confirmed that this text was encrypted/rotated using ROT-16.
