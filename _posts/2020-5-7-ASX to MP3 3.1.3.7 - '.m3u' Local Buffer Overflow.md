In this blog post we will be looking onto a Buffer Overflow Vulnerability which was found in ASX to MP3 converter application. We will be reproducing the exploit from scratch in order to learn more about BOFs.

If you are new to Buffer Overflows i will recommend you to read a comprehensive guide which i wrote for the newbies to get familiar with the basics of Buffer Overflows and how to exploit this vulnerability.

I will be using Windows XP machine to reproduce this vulnerability. The tools which we require are mentioned as above. 

### Tools of the trade
- Immunity Debugger
- Mona
- Python 

### Operating System
- Windows XP - SP3

### Vulnerable Software

# Let's Get Into It

The first thing is to download the vulnerable software from the provided link and install it on the machine. Once installed we can run the software which looks like as follows.

The Buffer Overflow vulnerability can be exploited by adding the M3U file to the application. As per WikiPedia, M3U files are:

> M3U (MP3 URL or Moving Picture Experts Group Audio Layer 3 Uniform Resource Locator in full) is a computer file format for a multimedia playlist. ... Although originally designed for audio files, such as MP3, it is commonly used to point media players to audio and video sources, including online sources.

So we come to conclusion that this file contains the URLs and the URL has to start with HTTP or HTTPS. We can generate a random M3U file by using python.

On loading the generated file in the application we can see that the application has failed to load the file. This is because we don't have anything in that for the time being.

Let's modify our code and add a buffer i.e. A character 2000 times. On generating the file and loading it within the application we can see the error which is nothing but a sequence of A characters. There is something really wrong going on here.

We can not exploit it any further by just playing around with the application. We will need a debugger. We will use Immunity Debugger. Drag & Drop the application executable onto Immunity Debugger. Once loaded you will see that the application has been loaded into the Immunity Debugger and is in paused state.

Click on the play/start button to start the application.

Now we will drag & drop the exploit.m3u file on the application but the thing which is requireed to be noted here is that we still haven't got the buffer overflow. We will need to add more buffer to our file.

Now, we will increase the buffer size from 2000 to 19999 and will generate a new file and will utilize that to see what is the output in the Immunity Debugger.

We can see that we have overwritten the EIP and ESP contains a steam of "A" characters. This proves that we are directly overwriting the EIP pointer and this type of Buffer Overflow is known as Direct Overflow / Vanilla Overflow because in such type of buffer overflows we can directly control the Instruction Pointer. From here we will move onto the exploitation phase and will end at running the caluclator on Windows XP by exploiting this vulnerability.
