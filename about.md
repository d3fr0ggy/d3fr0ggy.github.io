I am Kamran Saifullah. 20 years old Ethical Hacker, Security Researcher, Penetration Tester, Malware Analyst and Reverse Engineer from Pakistan. I've been an active 'Bug Bounty' hunter in the past but have now moved onto low level stuff like ASM, Firmware Analysis, Reverse Engineering etc. 

My work has been acknowledged by bunch of organization including but no limited to Google, Microsoft, Sony, BlackBerry, Adobe etc.

Also i have been an active participant in many online CTF competitions. I have also been involved in solving many different challenges on HackTheBox, VulnHub, CyberTalents, TryHackMe and many others (Individually). 

I am not a complete Malware Analyst and Reverse Engineer but i am on my way to be a proficient one very soon. It is a long journey indeed! 

##Special Thanks
